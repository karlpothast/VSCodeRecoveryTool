# VSCodeRecoveryTool
Recovers latest saved VSCode projects in case of accidental deletion.

> note - only tested on Linux but windows and mac should be nearly identical

> pulls recovery files from the latest version of each file saved in the local VSCode User History folder (/home/<user>/.config/Code/User/History on linux)
